# Local Office UI Package

Shared UI components based on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. This package will provide design primitives for the web application and any future admin console.

## Initial goals
- Establish design tokens and Tailwind configuration
- Implement reusable components for forms, tables, manifests, and status badges
- Support both light and dark themes for provider-facing workflows
