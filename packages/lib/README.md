# Local Office Shared Library

Utility functions that are reused across services, such as idempotency helpers, webhook signing, loyalty calculations, and referral credit logic.

## TODO
- Implement deterministic error codes and remediation hints
- Provide signing utilities compatible with webhook consumers and producers
- Share loyalty tier calculations between the API and billing services
