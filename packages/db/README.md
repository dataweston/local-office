# Local Office Database Package

This package will host the Prisma schema, migrations, and seeding utilities for Local Office. Other services will depend on the generated Prisma client from this workspace package.

## TODO
- Model entities for orgs, programs, orders, batches, invoices, loyalty, and referrals
- Provide seed data for baseline SKUs (pizza and sandwiches) with Midwest sourcing
- Expose helper scripts for migrations and local development databases
