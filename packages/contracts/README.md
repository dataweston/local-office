# Local Office API Contracts

Central home for the OpenAPI specification, JSON Schemas, and generated TypeScript SDK for Local Office services. Tooling here should make it easy for services and apps to consume consistent contracts.

## Planned contents
- `openapi.yaml` covering core `/v1` endpoints and webhook payloads
- JSON Schema definitions for orders, batches, invoices, incidents, loyalty, and referrals
- Code generation scripts to produce REST clients for TypeScript consumers

## Generating artifacts

Run the generation script to emit a bundled OpenAPI document, per-schema JSON Schemas, and a typed SDK:

```sh
pnpm --filter @local-office/contracts run generate
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/`:

- `dist/openapi.json` – canonical JSON representation of `openapi.yaml`
- `dist/schemas/*.json` – individual Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema files for each component
- `dist/types.d.ts` – TypeScript definitions generated by `openapi-typescript`
