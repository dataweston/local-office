# Local Office Web App

This directory will host the Next.js 14 App Router application for employees, admins, and providers. It will consume the shared UI components from `packages/ui` and call the REST API from `services/api` via the generated SDK in `packages/contracts`.

## Planned features
- Employee ordering with cutoff and subsidy visibility
- Admin program configuration and invoice review
- Provider batch manifests, label access, and delivery status tracking
